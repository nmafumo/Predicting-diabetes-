# Predicting-the-risk-of-diabetes-with-ML

This analysis aims to develop a classification model for diabetes by examining various health factors, including age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

By understanding the relationships between these factors and diabetes risk, we can improve disease prediction, early detection, and ultimately, patient outcomes.
